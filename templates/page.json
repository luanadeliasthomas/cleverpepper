Me, Alana Ruas and Clara Lins got on as soon as we met,  with our Dutch-Brazilian families, my background in fashion & product design and Clara biomedicine & fertility, sparked a fusion of arts meets science. Friends meets business partners. Clever Pepper was born.<\/p><h3>Why are we called Clever Pepper?<\/h3><p>In Brazil, 'pimentinha,' means 'little chilli pepper,' it's an affectionate way to describe kids who are active, intelligent, curious and sometimes a bit cheeky. Our name is part rhyming game “Clever”, part Brazilian “Pepper”.<\/p>",
